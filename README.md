# Telecom Churn Analysis

The **Telecom Churn Analysis** project focuses on understanding customer behavior and identifying factors contributing to customer churn. By analyzing customer demographics, contract types, payment methods, and tenure, the project aims to uncover key drivers of churn and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention. This analysis is crucial for developing targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Using a telecom dataset, the project processes and cleans the data with **Python** to facilitate exploration and analysis. Visualizations are created to effectively illustrate patterns and trends, such as churn likelihood across different customer segments, thereby supporting decision-making for reducing churn rates.
